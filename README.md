# Simple AES_ENC_DES

Simple AES encryption and Decryption.The message is encrypted using AES in CBC mode with a random key and IV(Initialization Vector). And in the decryption the code brute-forces the last byte of both the encryption key and the IV,trying every possible combination. 
Hope you enjoy this.

There maybe some bugs with the decryption I'll try to fix it soon.
